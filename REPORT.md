The purpose of this project is to practice:
- Using a public API (Dog API)
- Client-side programming with JavaScript (AJAX + JSON)
- Responsive UI design with Bootstrap
- Optional backend integration using PHP
- Version control and documentation

The application allows a user to select any dog breed and view images for that breed.  
It is a GUI application and must work on desktop and mobile.

2. Populate a dropdown with those breeds
3. Allow the user to select a breed
4. Fetch images for the chosen breed
5. Display images in a responsive grid
6. Use JSON data from the API
7. Use AJAX to call the API without page reload
8. Provide documentation and use version control

## Added Features (Improvements)
- Search/filter box for breeds
- Loading spinner while data is fetched
- Sub‑breed support (e.g., bulldog/english)
- Error messages in UI
- Pagination via “Load More” button
- Deployment instructions in README

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- AJAX (fetch API)
- JSON
- PHP (backend proxy)
- Git for version control

## Requirement Compliance (Assignment)
This web application uses the Dog API (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to fetch, display, and filter dog data.

The user can select any dog breed from the dropdown and view the available images for the selected breed.
Filtering is supported through the search box, which helps users quickly find breeds before selecting one.

The application uses a responsive Bootstrap layout and responsive image styling, so it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## API Operations Implemented
- List all breeds
- Images by breed
- Images by sub-breed
